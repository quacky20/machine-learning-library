# WOC 6.0 ML Bootcamp
The repository contains implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch. The only libraries used for the implementation are _numpy_, _matplotlib_ and _pandas_. The library contains code for **linear regression**, **polynomial regression**, **logistic regression**, **n - layer neural network**, **k - nearest neighbour algorithm** and **k - means algorithm**. I have uploaded the Jupyter notebooks with the outputs I obtained. The code can also be modified and hyperparameters can also be tuned accordingly. I have also uploaded the outputs of the test data I obtained using my algorithms.
