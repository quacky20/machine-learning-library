# 🚀 WOC 6.0 ML Bootcamp – Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository is a **personal showcase** of my machine learning implementations, built entirely from scratch 🔧  
Designed as part of the **WOC 6.0 ML Bootcamp**, this project demonstrates my understanding of core ML algorithms without relying on high-level libraries.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Only the essentials were used:

- 🧮 **NumPy** – For numerical computations  
- 📊 **Matplotlib** – For visualizations  
- 📋 **Pandas** – For data handling

No scikit-learn or TensorFlow here — just raw logic and clean code. 💪

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

Here’s what I’ve built from the ground up:

- 📈 **Linear Regression**  
- 🧮 **Polynomial Regression**  
- 🔐 **Logistic Regression**  
- 🧠 **N-layer Neural Network**  
- 📍 **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)**  
- 🎯 **K-Means Clustering**

Each implementation focuses on algorithmic clarity, performance, and reproducibility.

## 📂 Notebooks & Results

- 📝 Jupyter Notebooks with full code & outputs  
- 📊 Visuals for better insight into model behavior  
- 🧪 Test results included for all models

## 🔧 Modifiable & Tunable

The code is flexible — feel free to:

- 🛠️ Modify architectures  
- 🎚️ Tune hyperparameters  
- 🔄 Extend the models

This isn’t just code — it’s a demonstration of what I can build from scratch. 🧠⚡
